        WEmpower Foundation was created to combat misogyny and support women facing challenges like domestic violence, low-wage jobs, and limited autonomy in Masjid Moth.

        Our programs provide mothers and children with resources, leadership skills, and advocacy tools, strengthening family bonds and promoting gender equality. Together, we envision a future where both mothers and children have the resources and opportunities to thrive.
